# GA UI Pattern Project 3

UI pattern project. Initiated by going to digitalfences.github.io/UIPattern. 

## Getting Started

Navigate to the hosted site or clone down repo and run index.html in browser 

Code is in the HTML, Script, and css files. All css files must be present if you want the tab buttons at the top to work.
I used a modal pattern as the home page look. I intend to implement the other ui patterns in the tabs at the top.
A planned V2 of this project redone in react router is planned for release in May 2020
